# ThisFunc-Interpreter
# Interpreter for 'thisFunc' - A Functional Language

Welcome to the repository for the **Interpreter for 'thisFunc'**, a functional programming language designed to support key functional programming concepts. This interpreter processes and executes programs written in 'thisFunc,' a language focusing on clarity, purity, and immutability.

## Features

- **Functional Syntax**: Supports core functional programming features such as higher-order functions, recursion, and immutability.
- **Dynamic Function Definition**: Functions can be defined and called at runtime.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: The interpreter is minimal, focusing on simplicity and clarity in its design and execution.
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new features, such as additional built-in functions or error-handling mechanisms.
